# Maintainer info

This page complements the developer page and documents the
maintenance procedures related to making release for the
VS Code **xPack C/C++ Managed Build** extension.

## Prepare the release

Before making the release, perform some checks and tweaks.

### Update npm packages

- `npm outdated`
- for a while keep `@types/vscode` locked to `1.54.0`
- edit `package.json`  and `npm install`
- repeat until everything is up to date

### Check Git

In this Git repo:

- in the `develop` branch
- push everything
- if needed, merge the `master` branch

### Determine the next version

Use the semantic versioning semantics.

### Fix possible open issues

Check GitHub issues and pull requests:

- <https://github.com/xpack/vscode-xpack-extension-ts/issues/>

### Update Release Notes in `README.md`

- add a new entry in the Release Notes section
- check the rest of the file and update if needed, to reflect the new features
- update version in `README-MAINTAINER.md`

## Update `CHANGELOG.md`

- check the latest commits `npm run git-log`
- open the `CHANGELOG.md` file
- check if all previous fixed issues are in
- commit with a message like _prepare v0.4.14_

## Prepare a new blog post with the release

In the `xpack/web-jekyll` GitHub repo:

- select the `develop` branch
- add a new file to `_posts/releases/vscode-xpack`
- name the file like `2021-03-28-vscode-xpack-v0-4-11-released.md`
- name the post like: **VS Code xPack extension v0.4.14 released**
- update the `date:` field with the current date
- update the **Changes** sections

If any, refer to closed
[issues](https://github.com/xpack/vscode-xpack-extension-ts.git/issues/)
as:

```markdown
- [#1] ...
```

- commit with a message like **VS Code xPack extension v0.4.14 released**
- push
- wait for CI job to complete

## Publish to Marketplace

- terminate all running tasks (**Terminal** â†’ **Terminate Task...**)
- select the `develop` branch
- commit everything
- `npm run fix`
- in the develop branch, commit all changes
- `npm run test`
- `npm run package`; check the list of packaged files, possibly
  update `.vscodeignore`
- `npm version patch` (bug fixes), `npm version minor` (compatible API
  additions), `npm version major` (incompatible API changes)
- `npm run package`; again, to have an up-to-date .vsix
- push all changes to GitHub; this should trigger CI
- **wait for CI tests to complete**
