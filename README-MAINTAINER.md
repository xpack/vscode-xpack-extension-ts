# Maintainer info

This page complements the developer page and documents the
maintenance procedures related to making release for the
**xPack C/C++ Managed Build** VS Code extension.

## Prepare the release

Before making the release, perform some checks and tweaks.

### Update npm packages

- `npm outdated`
- `npm update` or edit and `npm install`
- repeat and possibly manually edit `package.json` until everything is
  up to date

### Check Git

In this Git repo:

- in the `develop` branch
- push everything
- if needed, merge the `master` branch

### Determine the next version

Use the semantic versioning semantics.

### Fix possible open issues

Check GitHub issues and pull requests:

- <https://github.com/xpack/vscode-xpack-extension-ts/issues/>

### Update Release Notes in `README.md`

- add a new entry in the Release Notes section
- check the rest of the file and update if needed, to reflect the new features
- update version in `README-MAINTAINER.md`

## Update `CHANGELOG.md`

- check the latest commits `npm run git-log`
- open the `CHANGELOG.md` file
- check if all previous fixed issues are in
- commit with a message like _prepare v0.4.8_

## Prepare a new blog post with the pre-release

In the `xpack/web-jekyll` GitHub repo:

- select the `develop` branch
- add a new file to `_posts/releases/vscode-xpack`
- name the file like `2021-03-28-vscode-xpack-v0-4-6-released.md`
- name the post like: **VS Code xPack extension v0.4.8 pre-release**
- update the `date:` field with the current date

  additions), `npm version major` (incompatible API changes)
